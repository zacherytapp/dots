## Choosing an Edition

Follow this decision tree:

```text
1. Does user specify edition? → Use specified edition
2. Does user need Partner edition? → Check if Dev Hub is Partner Business Org
3. Does user need Enterprise features? → Use enterprise
4. Default → Use developer
```

## CLI Usage

**With flag:**

```bash
sf org create scratch --edition developer --alias my-org
```

**With definition file:**

```json
{
  "edition": "Developer"
}
```

**Important notes:**

- Edition value is case-insensitive in CLI flags but case-sensitive in definition files (capital first letter)
- Partner edition CLI values are hyphenated: `partner-developer`, `partner-enterprise`, and so on.
- CLI flag `--edition` overrides definition file `edition` if both are specified
